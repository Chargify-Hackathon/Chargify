# Chargify

## Submission Name - Chargify

Currently, the number of electric car users in India is very low, our aim is to encourage people to make the switch from traditional ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles to electric ones by increasing the access to electric car chargers. 

It is a platform that bridges electric car users - ones who need to charge on the go- and people who have electric car chargers. This allows us to form a network of service providers (ones with chargers) and users( ones who need to charge their vehicle on the go).


### Short Description
 - __What's the problem__: There’s a silent transformation of petrol/diesel run vehicles to electric vehicles in India. The biggest impediment to this change is the lack of charging stations across the country thereby reducing the driving range.

 According to the Economic Times,  the running cost of EVs comes to Rs 1 per km, compared to Rs 9 for petrol and Rs 6 for Diesel ( Feb 17, 2021, source ). Furthermore, the cost of running electric cars is 89% less.  

 - __How can technology help__: Connecting people and sharing of resources has become very easy due to the involvement of technology. Chargify helps in the following ways:
    - Minimizes carbon footprints
    - Helps families lower their travel expenditures.
    - Overcomes the issue of low driving range- “range anxiety”
    - The conversion to EV reduces the stress on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels. 
    - It is low maintenance and encourages a low carbon economy.

- __The idea__: A well oiled charging infrastructure for electric vehicles hasn’t been developed in India, due to which a large number of people refuse to opt for the sustainable alternative to conventional cars- Electric cars. 

	Our technology is aligned with the UNDP goal 9- Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure. Our technology allows the users to form a network of service providers (ones with chargers) and car owners (ones who need to charge their vehicle on the go).
It is a platform that focuses on connecting people with chargers and electric car owners so that if anyone has a charger that’s not being used currently they can repurpose it for this specific platform and charge for it. This encourages people to shift to a greener alternative, i.e; Electric Cars.

### Long Description

When a person uses the Chargify application, they are first asked to sign up/login. The main screen opens up and you can view your current location and the available chargers.It shows chargers upto a distance of 5Km. The chargers are marked in three colors depending on their availability- green, yellow and red. 
- Green: available
- Yellow: busy
- Blue: unavailable 

__Adding chargers__: A chargify user can also contribute by setting up his charger in the app. Furthermore, current user location can be  determined by the map and one can locate a random location to verify the presence of a charger. The app user can also view available chargers at a saved location like Work or Home. 

__Payment__: As a prototype model, we have implemented a dummy wallet system as opposed to an entire payment portal. The dummy wallet allows the app user to add a certain amount of money into the wallet which is then used to pay the service providers.
